# All tutorials

Tutorials take you by the hand and explain everything. If it is your first time using Palang, this is a great place to start. And if you are more advanced, but you are not familiar with specific features, you may find a good example of what you want to do here.

The tutorials are separated in two categories: *writing Palang code* and *deploying Palang code*.

Palang wants to be a *minimal* programming language. Every program should be small. Most programs should be generic and easily resuable by other programs.

To use Palang, you do not need to write code. If your application is simple enough, you can simply deploy a stand-alone Palang server and import existing programs from online code repositories.

For example, if you want to use LLMs to summarize a document, there are `functions` and `prompts` for that in the standard code repository (`std`).

The tutorials are separated in these two categories because the experience will be very different depending on if you want to *write code* or to *deploy applications*.

## You want to write Palang code?
Get introduced to every feature of the Palang programming language incrementally with a series of tutorials.

&nbsp;&nbsp;1. [Hello world!](/tutorials/writing-code/1-hello-world)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. [Writing a prompt with custom inputs and outputs](/tutorials/writing-code/2-writing-a-prompt-with-custom-outputs)<br>

## You want to deploy Palang code?
Learn all the tricks and features of the Palang stand-alone server. With these tutorials, we focuse more on interacting with Palang applications rather than writing them.
